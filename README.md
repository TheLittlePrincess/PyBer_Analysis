# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview
The objective of this project is to present to V.Isualize and the PyBer team an analysis about ride-sharing by city type that may inform future decisions.

## **Analysis**

**Ride-sharing by city type**

-	It is clear that the urban market is the biggest market from the amount of rides, drivers and total fares collected. Urban fares add to almost ~$40K during the analyzed period, twice as much as the Suburban market and 9x the Rural one. However, when looked at average fares per ride and per driver, the relationship is the opposite for both: 
-	Drivers in the rural cities collect fares per ride that are 40% higher than those collected in the urban ones and even when less dramatic, still higher than those collected in the suburban cities. 
-	Fares collected by driver are also considerable higher, where the rural average is 3.4x the urban one.
-	The superplus of total drivers in the urban cites and likely shorter rides must be contributing to those averages. In contrast, a much leaner pool of drivers in the rural cities and probably longer distances likely contribute to the healthier fares. 
-	Nevertheless, the urban cities are by far the bigger contributors of fares  

**Weekly Ride-sharing by city type (Jan to April)**

-	Based on the graph, first observation is that, even though the fares are very different per each of the three types of cities, they share a spike in late February – would be good to understand better what drove it, to attempt to replicate it, given that it positively affected all three types.
-	The fares for the rural market seem to have some sort of biweekly cadence, as you can see more peaks throughout the analyzed period than for the other two.
-	The fares for the urban cities had a less smooth behavior during March, when a biweekly spike was also observed, however seems to have smoothed during April
-	Without digging deeper (yet), the trend for fares for rural cities seem rather steady, while for urban ones, seems to be having a positive trend. Suburban ones, if likely on the positive side, less noticeable. Is good that the urban fares are increasing since are the bigger contributors, but it also suggests we should try to grow the others as well.

## **Summary**

Based on the above analysis, here are some recommendations to address the disparities among city types

-	Increase drivers in the rural areas. More drivers can contribute to add rides and increase fares collected. Things like sign up bonus for drivers can help.
-	Find more details about the biweekly seasonality that is suggested by the graph, to see if is due to higher demand on the peaks or to less drivers being available on the valleys to address accordingly.
-	Towards the end of February, a peak can be observed for all 3 city types, the recommendation is to try to determine if there was a promotion on the drivers’ side, the user side or what could have contributed to replicate.
-	Dig deeper on options to increase the urban cites average fare, through more riders/rides and/or longer rides.
